## Experimental Data

The individual data files in `data/` should be rather self-explanatory.

`bash report.sh data/` re-generates all derived result files from the base result files (`data/*table*`).  
Edit the bottom of `report.sh` to also output plots; in these cases, you need the content of the repository https://github.com/domschrei/plotscripts in your `$PATH`.
